# wolf3d
In this project you must follow in the footsteps of this brillant programmer and write
your own version of Wolfenstein 3D... Hold on, we won’t ask you to re-write not the
ENTIRE Wolfenstein 3D. One has to be be realistic here. Your mission will be to write,
using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find
his/her way.

# DESCRIPTION

Educational project in School 42 (UNIT Factory Kyiv).

Task: This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research, data mining etc.
As a graphic design project, Wolf3D will enable you to solidify your skills in this area:
windows, colors, events, fill shapes etc.
To conclude Wolf3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications
of mathematics without having to understand the specifics. With the help of the numerous documents
available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient
algorithms.

Wolf3D is written in C language with the use of the library mlx(minilibx).
